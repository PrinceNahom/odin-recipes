    <figure>Gomen Besiga is a variation of Gomen (Ethiopian Collard Green Salad) – but includes meat. It’s quite popular in Ethiopia among meat lovers as a healthier option among other meat dishes. Gomen Besiga can be served as an entrée or side dish, depending on your preference. But, it’s typically served during holidays and special occasions in Ethiopia.
